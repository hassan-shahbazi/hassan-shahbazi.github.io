<p>When I started my journey as a Software Engineer back in 2011, I was asked to develop iOS applications. It was a small team, and I was joined as an intern, so I took the opportunity and to be honest, it was a wise choice. Working on Mobile projects, in my opinion, is always a good starting point for recently graduated or even students as it is easier to learn and still requires knowledge that helps newbies to get better in software development.</p>
<p>However, for many years, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to accept more challenging responsibilities. Although I have had the chance to contribute to different projects including the backend, my high-priority assigned tasks have always been the iOS project. It didn&rsquo;t matter how interesting assigned tasks were, which mainly were very challenging in their scale, they would never satisfy my soul as a software engineer. If you look into the Mobile Development industry, you&rsquo;ll find a lot of articles and &ldquo;patterns&rdquo; that might seem very interesting, but using them on such small scales (most of the time, not always), is just a way to add some spices to boring tasks.</p>
<p>These are why I finally decided to take a big and important decision. I started learning some skills in my spare time, especially, in the low-level operating systems. I studied Linux Kernel and tried to take courses for debugging and learning it. I also tried to challenge myself in different ways, including configuring and installing Linux Kernel manually, writing simple Kernel modules, doing <em>LittlePenguin</em> challenges, etc. Eventually, all these steps paid off and I could get a very interesting offer from <a href="https://f-secure.com">F-Secure</a> as a Senior Developer mainly for the <em>macOS</em> team, where we go beyond user interfaces and deal with low-level concepts and the operating system more in-depth.</p>
<p>I am very thankful to <a href="https://ninchat.com">Ninchat</a> for the opportunity and trust they gave to me and helped me to learn much more than just what I had been asked to work on. Timo, a good friend I am so proud to had talks about both technical and soft skills with. I got so much product-wise knowledge from Antti and Hermanni, and I never forget our Linux discussions with Sami. Pallab, a great engineer taught me how to adopt different skills and be a great team player. Jaffa was a great friend helping me to finish my Master&rsquo;s Thesis. And finally, Ville and Heini, who helped me during the most difficult days of my life with the best you can ever expect.</p>
