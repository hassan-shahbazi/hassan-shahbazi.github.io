<p><em>Write once, Run anywhere</em> has been a dream for decades among software companies and developers. The idea of removing duplicated code is not just about doing most with least costs, but also about avoiding disasters of forgetting to update all copies. If you have ever contributed in a large-scale software project (even in a small one), you probably have seen how different teams try to centralize core solutions and algorithms to avoid duplication.</p>
<p>However, I believe not many of them have been successful in this path. In a 3-part essay published on Medium, I have introduced <strong>WebAssembly</strong> and described how it can help developers to achieve performance improvements for both front-end and back-end tasks. The essays contain a brief example about benefiting from <strong>Wasm</strong> to bring advantages of <em>Swift</em> language to a <em>Go</em> application.</p>
