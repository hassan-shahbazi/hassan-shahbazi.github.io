<h1>On Meditation Leave - Until 2022 Jan 1st</h1>

<p>In my culture, or to be more precise, in Islamic culture, there is an approach to meditate and &ldquo;clean&rdquo; yourself by doing (or repeating) a behaviour for 40 days. It is called <em>40ish method</em>, or what we call it in Persian, <em>Chelle Neshini</em>. This is not only in Islam, but in many other religious there is a same sort of instruction. Although I&rsquo;m not a religious man and this doesn&rsquo;t aim to improve my relation with God, I think I would like to give it a try. Particularly, due to difficult days I&rsquo;m experiencing since summer and I have already talked about them in another post.</p>
<p>Thus, I would be away from all social media for 40 days, or even more. Probably until the new year. And by social media, I mean twitter, facebook, instagram, linkedin, and telegram. If you think you need to talk with me, I will still accessible through my email (<a href="hassan@shahbazi.fi">mailto:hassan@shahbazi.fi</a>) or WhatsApp if you have number. I will either get back as a healthy man, or won&rsquo;t return anymore.</p>
<p>See you!</p>
