<p>Everybody sees life in a particular way, not just because of the physical differences, but mainly because of how real-world events are perceived and processed in their mind. In fact, there is no way we can tell if somebody is <em>right</em> or <em>wrong</em> about the way they see the life. For me, life is dark and painful.</p>
<p>I used to be a religious man. If you go back in my life, you&rsquo;ll find more and more signs of believes. When I was young, I was completely brainwashed about how the world is smart, and how we people are destined toward a meaningful death. But as the time passed, I found myself more and more into asking. Asking about &lsquo;how&rsquo; and now &lsquo;who&rsquo;. Asking how things are gonna work when we are dead. Now, in about 30 years, I&rsquo;m writing this page while laying in my bed in a mental hospital in Lappeenranta.</p>
<p>I see the life as a pie-chart. It consists of two big chunks, brightness and darkness. When we are born, it&rsquo;s all brightness, 100%. Although it might not be applied to some people who are born with issues, it is almost the same feeling we all had. And by the time passes, the darkness hardly tries to take its portion back. And to be realistic, it is successful. Since the life is a pie-chart, darkness cannot grow unless the brightness shrinks. The darkness grow and grow until all we see is darkness, even if it is not yet 100%.</p>
<p>We grow old, and that means pain. We get closer and closer to death. Just like a boat on a river that ends to a waterfall. Some people can ignore that, and some people are unable to hear the sound of the waterfall. But some people, like me, they can&rsquo;t enjoy anything else as long as the waterfall sound is getting stronger and stronger. I really envy the people who are sitting in the other side of the boat, who are able (consciousely or unconsciousely) to avoid the fear. But I am not.</p>
<p>We grow old, and that means we will be sick. We are already sick and weak. We don&rsquo;t have the enjoyment of ourselves when we were 10. We can&rsquo;t eat as much as we want, and we simply get down by a very trivial body problem. We are suffering from aging, but some people try to be optimistic. They believe that is worth of getting new experiencing, but not me.</p>
<p>We grow old, and that means we will see our darlings die. I believe the most lucky people are the ones who die before their parents. They don&rsquo;t have to spend times and days and years thinking about them. They don&rsquo;t have to witness their friends pass away one by one.</p>
<p>We grow old, and we finally die, while the darkness has invaded our life completely. After a certain point, we have nothing but the pain. We have nothing but memories. We have nobody who knows us by our first name. We have nobody who we can share a memory. We are tortured by the past, and wishing the death to come sooner.</p>
<p>I believe the whole world is built based on our minds. If we were developed based on another creature, we would have completely a different view about the world. We already can see just a part of the world, as our brain is unable to process anything else. With that in mind, death is not just me getting vanished in the darkness, but it means the whole world is dead with me. Imagine a mobile game that you have a character to play with. When the app is killed, not just that character, but the whole world it was <em>living</em> there is dead. There are no parents anymore. No friends, no experiences, no pain, no happiness. And if that&rsquo;s really the case, why would be taking suffers until the death comes to us? Why shouldn&rsquo;t we finish it earlier? What is the point of being 100 when you start suffering since you&rsquo;re born?</p>
<p>I have only one question. A very simple one. And I would gladly continue the life if I can find the answer. The question is, <strong>What is the reward of having pain? What will we gain after taking so much pain?</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take me serious. As I said, I&rsquo;m a mental man. I have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about. Live your life the way you want, and forget about me. I&rsquo;ll go to vanish very soon, and this shouldn&rsquo;t make your life more miserable.</p>
<p>See you!
Hassan</p>
