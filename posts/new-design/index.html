<p>On the last day of February 2021, I decided to improve how my website looks and feels. The old version was nice, but it was full of useless information and details. I was looking for a minimalist place to share my knowledge, link my social accounts and emails, and help people know me better as a developer and human being. Since I&rsquo;m not a fan of heavy animations and fancy UI components, I got impressed extensively by simple examples such as <a href="https://savo.la">Timo Savola</a> and <a href="https://lxsameer.com">Sameer Rahmani</a>. Additionally, since the website has been built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, I had many options to choose from as the theme. I looked into several ones and finally decided to continue with <a href="https://github.com/invinciblycool/lekh">lekh</a>.</p>

<p><em>lekh</em> was the closest match with what I had in mind. It is a minimalist, fast, nice, and informative theme which was fitted with my needs, though it was not the exact match. Therefore, despite my trivial knowledge of developing webpages, I had to hack the theme. I <a href="https://github.com/hassan-shahbazi/lekh">forked</a> the project in GitHub and then apply few updates on how elements are rendered. The result was the one I loved. It contains all sections as simple as the could, yet they are informative and easy to reach.</p>
<p>My initial plan is to publish articles not only in English but also in Farsi (or even in Finnish, who knows? :D). These articles would be mostly about programming topics, though I feel I can write about different things that would be helpful for others as well. I like to talk about books I have recently read, movies I have recently watched, or even about my new interests and hobbies.</p>
<p>With all said, I want to raise a glass to my new website and the new life that has begun.</p>
